       This component is a work in progress.\nThe asset dropdown button is used to create a split dropdown button with all of the enabled ABO actions on the storefront record.\nBy default the first action in the list of enabled actions is set as the primary action on the button, however, users can set the desired primary action with the 'primaryAction' input.\nAn onClick event is emitted when a user clicks on the main button or one in the dropdown.\nPreview\n\nUsage\n\nimport { ButtonModule } from '@congarevenuecloud/elements';\n\n@NgModule({\nimports: [ButtonModule, ...]\n})\nexport class

Description\n    \n    \n        The date range component includes two date input fields one for start date and one for end date. The input fields use the ngx-bootstrap date picker component.\nBy default the date range component will calculate the begining and ending date for the cart item that is passed to it based on the frequency and term of the product.\nWhen the user selects a date in the start date or end date inputs the onStartDateChange and onEndDateChange methods will be fired respectively.\nPreview\n\nUsage\n\nimport { InputDateModule } from '@congarevenuecloud/elements';\n\n@NgModule({\nimports: [InputDateModule, ...]\n})\nexport class AppModule {}// Basic

Description\n    \n    \n        The Mini Cart component is a cart icon with an associated dropdown menu. The cart icon should be displayed in a fixed header of a page so it is accessible to the user at all times. Once items have been added to the user's current cart a badge will appear next to the Mini Cart icon with the total number of items.\nWhen a user clicks the Mini Cart icon the associated dropdown menu will be displayed. The Mini Cart dropdown menu shows the current line items that have been added to the cart. Line items include information about the product, controls for updating the quantity of items, and a control for removing the item from the cart. A cart total price and checkout button are also shown in the Mini Cart dropdown.\nPreview\n\nUsage\n\nimport { MiniCartModule } from '@congarevenuecloud/elements';\n\n@NgModule({\nimports:
